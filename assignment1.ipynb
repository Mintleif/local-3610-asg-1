Midtown Center and Upper East Side South are nearly tied for the highest volume, suggesting that both commercial business districts and dense residential neighborhoods contribute heavily to taxi activity. The inclusion of both JFK and LaGuardia Airports within the top ten highlights the significant role of airport travel in overall trip volume. Additionally, several Midtown and Upper East/West Side zones appear in the ranking, confirming that Manhattan dominates pickup activity. The noticeable drop after the top four zones indicates that demand becomes more dispersed outside the most central and transit-connected areas.

There is also a secondary elevation around 4 AM and 6 AM, suggesting that early-morning trips tend to be longer or higher-value rides. After 7 AM, fares stabilize and remain relatively consistent throughout standard daytime hours, indicating more routine urban travel patterns. The slight increase again near 11 PM may reflect late-night travel or airport-bound rides. The pronounced early-morning spike suggests that trip distance, rather than congestion, may be the primary driver of higher fares during that period.
